# BullsAndCows
Inspired by many iterations of BullsAndCows game, I decided to create a version using the same concept for guessing an isogram word instead of digits. The game will randomly pick a hidden isogram word from a word list. It will provide player with the first and the last letters of the hidden word as a hint. Player will fill in the missing letter/s in between to uncovered the hidden word. 
## Rules:
1. Player will fill in the missing letter/s in between within a time limit.
2. For every correct letter in the correct position to the hidden word, player will get the same number of *Bull*.
3. For every present letter in the incorrect position to the hidden word, player will get the same number of *Cow*.
4. For every correct word guessed, player will be able to proceed to the next round with a new hidden word. At the same time, player will be granted additional 30 seconds to the total of current time limit. 
## Goal:
The goal of the game is to get the highest score/round as posible.
## Losing Condition:
Unable to solve the hidden word before reaching the time limit.
